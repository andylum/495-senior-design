# Revitalizing Solar Insights: A Dashboard for West Tennessee Solar Farm
Andy Lum and Joshua Chamberlain

## Description
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our senior design class project! Our project aims to construct an interactive dashboard to visualize and retrieve solar irradiance data collected at the West Tennessee Solar Farm near Stanton, Tennessee.
The University of Tennessee Research Foundation is interested in revitalizing this site due to its proximity to the new Ford plant. Currently, the interactive dashboard located on the Farmâ€™s website does not work. We plan to make use of
R, Shiny, Python, SQL, HTML, Java Script, and CSS. The plan is to use simulatedsolar irradiance data and a hypothetical layout of sensors at the plant.
