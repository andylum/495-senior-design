            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>How do solar panels work?</h3>
                    <p>Solar panels work by capturing sunlight and converting it into electricity through a process called the photovoltaic effect. Each solar panel consists of solar cells made of semiconductor materials, usually silicon, which generate a flow of electrons when exposed to sunlight. This flow of electrons creates direct current (DC) electricity, which is then converted into usable alternating current (AC) electricity through an inverter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>What are the different types of solar panels?</h3>
                    <p>There are several types of solar panels, including monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film. Monocrystalline panels are known for their efficiency and sleek appearance, while polycrystalline panels are cost-effective. Thin-film panels are lightweight and flexible, making them suitable for specific applications.</p>

                    <h3>How much energy can a solar farm produce?</h3>
                    <p>The energy production of a solar farm depends on several factors, including its size, location, efficiency of solar panels, and available sunlight. On average, a well-designed solar farm can generate enough electricity to power hundreds or even thousands of homes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>What is the lifespan of solar panels?</h3>
                    <p>Solar panels typically have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years. However, they can continue to produce electricity at a reduced efficiency beyond that period. Regular maintenance and monitoring can help maximize their lifespan.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>What is the role of a solar farm in renewable energy?</h3>
                    <p>Solar farms play a crucial role in generating clean and renewable energy. They harness sunlight to produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases, contributing to a reduction in carbon emissions and combating climate change. Solar farms also support energy diversification and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>How are solar farms designed for optimal energy production?</h3>
                    <p>Solar farms are strategically designed to maximize energy production. Factors such as panel orientation, tilt angle, and spacing between panels are optimized to capture the most sunlight throughout the day. Additionally, advanced tracking systems can follow the sun's path for even greater efficiency.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>What is solar irradiance and how does it affect energy production?</h3>
                    <p>Solar irradiance refers to the amount of sunlight energy received per unit area. It plays a critical role in energy production because the intensity of sunlight directly impacts the electricity output of solar panels. Higher irradiance levels lead to greater energy generation, while factors like shading and weather conditions can reduce irradiance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>How is solar irradiance measured and monitored?</h3>
                    <p>Solar irradiance is measured using instruments called pyranometers or solar radiometers. These devices quantify the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface. In solar farms, multiple sensors are often deployed to monitor irradiance levels continuously, allowing for real-time adjustments to maximize energy production.</p>
