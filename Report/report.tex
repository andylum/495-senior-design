\begin{abstract}
This project we constructed aims to be an interactive dashboard for displaying solar irradiance data collected at a photovoltaic power station. Given a recent push by the University of Tennessee Research Foundation toward revitalizing its use, the West Tennessee Solar Farm will serve as a template. This location is of particular interest due to its proximity to Blue Oval City (the site of the new Ford manufacturing plant, near Stanton, TN). With the farmâ€™s existing dashboard being non-functional, there is a demand for a solution, which we will achieve through MySQL, Python, Google Drive API, R-Shiny, Shinyapps.io, and Google Cloud Console.
MySQL serves as our data hub, efficiently organizing solar energy data by sensor location. Python, coupled with the Google Drive API, simulates real-time data collection. 

The core of the project is an R-Shiny dashboard offering real-time data visualization, interactive maps, detailed sensor information, and access to historical data and analysis. Users can select their desired time frames. Shinyapps.io hosts the dashboard, ensuring accessibility across diverse platforms, such as web browsers and various operating systems. This approach allows users from all major operating systems to access the dashboard, promoting widespread accessibility. To further fortify data security and enhance user convenience, Google Cloud Console safeguards our API information.
Our dashboard incorporates an export function, enabling users to extract data. In addition, we constructed an easy-to-use webpage that is accessible across various major operating systems. This approach ensures that our project is widely available and caters to a diverse audience; thus, making valuable solar irradiance data easily accessible to all. This project aims to provide researchers, policymakers, and the public with real-time insights into solar irradiance data at the West Tennessee Solar Farm, supporting sustainable energy solutions.

\section{Introduction}

In the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, our project ventures to unlock the vast potential of solar irradiance data. Our focus is on the West Tennessee Solar Farm, situated near Stanton, TN \cite{WTSF}. Its strategic proximity to Blue Oval City adds notable importance. The critical challenge we address is the current, non-functional existing dashboard for the solar farm, which has left vital solar irradiance data inaccessible for potential users. The West Tennessee Solar Farm offers the potential for abundant clean energy, but its potential remains unrealized in part due to the limitations of the existing dashboard. In this project, we aspire to bridge this data accessibility gap while opening up opportunities to inform and educate the general public about the farm's renewable energy potential.


In response to this need, our project emerges as a symbol of innovation and accessibility, seamlessly integrating an array of cutting-edge technologies. With MySQL as our data hub, we thoroughly organize solar energy data by sensor location. Python, in collaboration with the Google Drive API, takes on the role of capturing and decoding real-time data with unwavering precision. However, the importance of our project lies in R-Shiny dashboard, an interactive interface that goes beyond the typical data visualization. It not only brings solar irradiance data to life in real-time but also empowers users with interactive maps, intricate sensor insights, information that is relatable to the lay-person, and a comprehensive historical archive.


\section{Technologies Used}

\subsection{MySQL}
The MySQL database was used to store information about irradiance collected from data sensors. The database schema included a main table called Irradiance that contained the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] The day of year the data was recorded in, ranging from 1 - 365 representing each day of the year.
\item[2.] The minute of the day that the data was recorded in, ranging from 1 - 1440 representing each minute of the day.
\item[3.] 10 separate columns containing the collected irradiance from each sensor in watts per meter squared ($\dfrac{W}{m^2}$). 
\item[4.] The total irradiance of all sensors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Python}
The python program uses the mysql library\cite{MySQL} to connect to the database and retrieve data from the database. It gets the information at a rate of 1 minute, providing real time updates to the R-Shiny dashboard. It does this by creating a query that is then executed on the database.

\subsection{R-Shiny}
Through multiple packages, R-Shiny is used to perform statistical analyses and to plot both power production and irradiance. It also holds the code for the user interface and performs the conversion between irradiance and power production. 

\subsection{ShinyApps.io} 
ShinyApps.io is used to host the dashboard as a website on the cloud. It gives access to the dashboard for the public. This is essential since one of the main goals of the project is to make it an educational tool as well as a research tool. It uses the Posit Cloud, which is the main cloud server for R-Shiny programs.

\subsection{Google Cloud Console}
Google Cloud Console is used to secure the data being transferred to the website. It protects it by masking passwords and API keys to the database and the APIs being used.

\section{R Packages}
R packages play a pivotal role in bringing the solar farm data dashboard to life. R packages are collections of functions, documentation, and sample data bundled together for specific tasks or purposes. In the project, several key R packages have been harnessed to create a robust and interactive dashboard, catering to the real-time needs of the solar farm data:

\subsection{Shiny}

Shiny is an R package used to bridge the gap between R and HTML. It was used to design the UI of the dashboard as well as connecting the data collected from the MySQL database to the R program. Finally, it allowed reactivity in the R program, making real time data visualization possible.\cite{R-Shiny}\cite{Wickham_2021}

\subsection{Leaflet}

Leaflet is used to provide the map and all of its functionalities. It uses the satellite photos from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) for the interactive picture of the solar farm. Leaflet also contributed to the popups and zoom features of the map, allowing the user to have easy access to information from each sensor.\cite{Leaflet}

\subsection{OpenMeteo}

OpenMeteo is an API used for weather forecasting and historical data analysis. It allowed for forecasting the next day on the dashboard. It provided the hourly cloud cover, hourly temperature, weather code, and the amount of shortwave UV radiation. The hourly variables were averaged for user convenience.\cite{OpenMeteo}

\subsection{Google Drive}
The google drive package allows the program to connect to google drive files. It is used to connect to the csv file that contains all the processed data for the dashboard plots and sensor information.\cite{GD}

\subsection{Rsconnect}
The rsconnect package connects the R-shiny application to shinyapps.io server. \cite{RSConnect}

\subsection{GGPlot2 and Plotly}
GGPlot2 and Plotly allows for the interactivity in the plots. It allows the user to hover over the plot and see the minute the data was gathered and the irradiance at that time. It also allows null data to be absent from the dataset. 
\section{Dashboard Features}

\subsection{Reactive Plots}
The dashboard's main feature is the reactive plots that show the current irradiance level or power production. The plots are able to change from live plot to daily plots. Also within the daily plots, the plots can switch between irradiance and power production. It does this using a formula gathered through scientific study.\cite{PowerConversion}

\subsection{Interactive Map}
The map that shows the West Tennessee Solar Farm\cite{WTSF} from an ariel view. It has clickable sensors that pop-up with the current irradiance value at that time. The sensors change colors when one is abnormally low or abnormally high. It is colored based on a red to green gradient. The map also has the capability to zoom in and out. All of the interactivity and reactivity within the map was made using the Leaflet package.\cite{Leaflet}

\subsection{Weather Forecast Table}
The dashboard has a weather forecast for the next day. It gives the cloud cover, temperature, weather code, and total predicted shortwave ultraviolet radiation. This allows not only users to know the predicted forecast, it also allows the West Tennessee Solar Farm to plan storage based on how much power the farm will have to supplement the main power supply.

\subsection{Exporting Daily Data}
The dashboard has a button to download the specific days data the user is looking at as a csv. This is achieved using the downloadHandler in Shiny.\cite{R-Shiny} Pressing the button will pop up with a "Save As" screen on the users local computer. By default it will name the file in the format, mm-dd-yyyy.csv, where the date is the current days plot the user is looking at.

\subsection{Educational Features}
The dashboard has two educational sections. The first section is a description of what irradiance is. The second section contains reactive text that converts the total power production to more relatable units: amount of houses powered and how many electric cars are being powered. This calculated for the day, week, and month.

\section{Other Features}
Along with the dashboard there are two other tabs.
\subsection{Solar Power Process}
The tab explains in a simple format how the solar panels collect sunlight and convert it to power. It uses the fade in CSS animation to keep users engaged. It is meant to serve as an education and research tool for the public outreach and awareness.
\subsection{Frequently Asked Questions}
The tab answers Frequently Asked Questions about solar farms and the solar power process. 
\section{Figures/Captions}

Place figures and tables at the top or bottom of the appropriate
column or columns, on the same page as the relevant text (see
Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}). A figure or table may extend across both
columns to a maximum width of 17.78 cm (7 in.).

%% \begin{figure*}
%%   \centering
%%   \includegraphics[width=1.75\columnwidth]{figures/map}
%%   \caption{In this image, the map maximizes use of space. You can make
%%     figures as wide as you need, up to a maximum of the full width of
%%     both columns. Note that \LaTeX\ tends to render large figures on a
%%     dedicated page. Image: \ccbynd~ayman on
%%     Flickr.}~\label{fig:figure2}
%% \end{figure*}

Captions should be Times New Roman or Times Roman 9-point bold.  They
should be numbered (e.g., ``Table~\ref{tab:table1}'' or
``Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}''), centered (if one line) otherwise justified, and placed beneath the figure
or table.  Please note that the words ``Figure'' and ``Table'' should
be spelled out (e.g., ``Figure'' rather than ``Fig.'') wherever they
occur. Figures, like Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}, may span columns and
all figures should also include alt text for improved accessibility.
Papers and notes may use color figures, which are included in the page
limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black-and-white in
the proceedings.

The paper may be accompanied by a short video figure (we recommend staying within five
minutes in length). However, the paper should stand on its own without
the video figure, as the video may not be available to everyone who
reads the paper.  

\subsection{Inserting Images}
When possible, include a vector formatted graphic (i.e. PDF or EPS).
When including bitmaps,  use an image editing tool to resize the image
at the appropriate printing resolution (usually 300 dpi).

\section{Quotations}
Quotations may be italicized when \textit{``placed inline''}.

\begin{quote}
Longer quotes, when placed in their own paragraph, need not be
italicized or in quotation marks when indented.  
\end{quote}

\section{Language, Style, and Content}

The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and
punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian,
US, etc.) provided this is done consis- tently. Hyphenation is
optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please
pay attention to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write in a straightforward style.
\item Try to avoid long or complex sentence structures.
\item Use common and basic vocabulary (e.g., use the word ``unusual'' rather than the word ``arcane''.
\item Briefly define or explain all technical terms that may be
  unfamiliar to readers.
\item Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your
  text---e.g., ``Digital Signal Processing (DSP)''.
\item Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city
  names in a particular country).
\item Explain ``insider'' comments. Ensure that your whole audience
  understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g.,
  do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
  application).
\item Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like
  ``red herring'' may require a local knowledge of English.  Humor and
  irony are difficult to translate.
\item Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as
  times, dates, currencies, and numbers (e.g., ``1--5--97'' or
  ``5/1/97'' may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock'' may
  mean 7:00 am or 19:00). For currencies, indicate equivalences:
  ``Participants were paid {\fontfamily{txr}\selectfont \textwon}
  25,000, or roughly US \$22.''
\item Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she)
  and other gendered words (chairman, manpower, man-months). Use
  inclusive language that is gender-neutral (e.g., she or he, they,
  s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours, person-years). See the
  \textit{Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing} for further advice and
  examples regarding gender and other personal
  attributes~. Be particularly aware of
  considerations around writing about people with disabilities.
\item If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set
  for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g.,
  Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k, Lafreni\'ere, S\'anchez, Nguy{\~{\^{e}}}n,
  Universit{\"a}t, Wei{\ss}enbach, Z{\"u}llighoven, \r{A}rhus, etc.).
  These characters are already included in most versions and variants
  of Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Accessibility}
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI
conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and
educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors
are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their
submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the
following five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Add alternative text to all figures
\item Mark table headings
\item Add tags to the PDF
\item Verify the default language
\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{enumerate}
For more information and links to instructions and resources, please
see: \url{http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility}.  The
\texttt{{\textbackslash}hyperref} package allows you to create well tagged PDF files,
please see the preamble of this template for an example.

\section{Page Numbering, Headers and Footers}
Your final submission should not contain footer or header information
at the top or bottom of each page. Specifically, your final submission
should not include page numbers. Initial submissions may include page
numbers, but these must be removed for camera-ready. Page numbers will
be added to the PDF when the proceedings are assembled.

\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL
Compliant. The requirements for an ACM Compliant PDF are available at:
{\url{http://www.scomminc.com/pp/acmsig/ACM-DL-pdfs-requirements.htm}}.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 10. This is
widely available at no cost. Note that most
reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
reader, so please check your PDF accordingly.

\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience. Please read
previous years' proceedings to understand the writing style and
conventions that successful authors have used. It is particularly
important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
published work, i.e., the unique contribution that your work makes to
the field. Please consider what the reader will learn from your
submission, and how they will find your work useful. If you write with
these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be successful,
both in being accepted into the conference, and in influencing the
work of our field.
